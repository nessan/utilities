# README

This `doxytests` directory will get populated with source files generated by [Doxytest].

`Doxytest` scans comments in the project's header files for fenced code blocks.
It extracts those as test programs and puts those in this folder.

The generated files are _not_ checked into `git` as they get updated automatically when the library's sources change.

Our `CMakeLists.txt` has a "Generate_doxytest_sources" build target that forces `Doxytest` to repopulate this directory with test sources.
Run targets are added for all the individual headers in the library, as well as a combined target `doxytests` that runs all the extracted tests.
