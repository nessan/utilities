## Introduction

{cpp23} introduces {std.print} as an addition to the standard formatting library.

If your compiler does not yet support {std.print}, the `<utilities/print.h>` header file supplies a workaround.

[Example]{.bt}
```cpp
#include <utilities/format.h>
#include <utilities/print.h>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
#ifdef __cpp_lib_print
    std::cout << "The compiler has std::print!\n";
#else
    std::cout << "I will use the std::print workaround!\n";
#endif
    std::vector v = {1.123123, 2.1235, 3.555555};
    std::print("Unformatted vector: {}\n", v);
    std::print("Formatted vector:   {::3.2f}\n", v);W
}
```

[Output]{.bt}
```sh
I will use the std::print workaround!
Unformatted vector: [1.123123, 2.1235, 3.555555]
Formatted vector:   [1.12, 2.12, 3.56]
```
